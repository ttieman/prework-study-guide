## Description

This Pre-work Study Guide website was created to serve as a way to return and review notes collected throughout my time in coding bootcamp. Keep notes is essential for studying important information that could be valuable throughout the course. 
This website will also randomly assign a topic to start with in the console every time you refresh the page or visit. 
This site can be updated in the coding files, and will also server as an excellent practice medium throughout the course.

The Sections in the website currently consist of:

1. HMTL
2. CSS
3. Git
4. JavaScript

Building this was extremley helpful in getting the foundation to start putting together basic webpages, and will help my skills only grow.
